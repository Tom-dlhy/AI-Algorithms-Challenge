    "The implementation of the Genetic Algorithm with elitism has yielded an improved result of 630, outperforming the previous value of 613. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of elitism, where the top-performing individuals are preserved across generations, ensuring that their quality traits are retained. By reserving 20% of the population as elite, the algorithm avoids the risk of losing high-quality solutions due to random mutations or suboptimal crossovers. The combination of elitism, roulette wheel selection, and mutation introduces a balanced exploration and exploitation of the solution space, leading to a higher-quality placement of biscuits on the dough while respecting all constraints."

    "The implementation of tournament selection combined with crossover and 20% elitism resulted in a total value of 639, an improvement over the previous value of 630. Tournament selection enhances the algorithm by focusing on a subset of individuals in each selection round, favoring fitter candidates while still allowing diversity. This method, coupled with crossover, ensures effective exploration of the solution space by combining traits from selected parents. The 20% elitism guarantees the preservation of top-performing individuals across generations, maintaining a high-quality baseline. These mechanisms work together to achieve a balance between exploiting known good solutions and exploring new ones, yielding better results within the same number of generations."

This heuristic directly aligns with the goal of maximizing value while minimizing space and defect penalties. By prioritizing high-value, space-efficient biscuits, the greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal results with far less computational complexity compared to the stochastic nature of genetic algorithms, which can struggle to match the precision of a well-chosen heuristic within limited iterations.\n",
